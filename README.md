# Fashion-Generative-model


GAN or Generative Adversarial Networks is an unsupervised learning technique which can generate data after learning from training data. GAN can be divided into two networks, i.e. a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network takes in random noise to produce an image. The discriminator tries to identify if the data given to it is synthetic or real training data. 

This repository aims at generating fashion designs to statisfy any client request on the base of a relevant dataset called Fashion MNIST dataset:
